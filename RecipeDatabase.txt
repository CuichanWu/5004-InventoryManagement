Coronation chicken pasties recipe///
curry sauce, oil, potato, curry powder, chicken, onion, mango chutney, pastry, egg///
1 tbsp oil; 250g baking potatoes, peeled and cut into approx 1cm cubes; 1½ tbsp mild curry powder; 1½ x 220g packs cooked chicken breast, cut into 2cm pieces; 4 spring onions, roughly chopped; 250g korma curry sauce (from a 500g jar); 3 tbsp mango chutney, plus extra to serve; 2 x 375g packs shortcrust pastry ; 1 egg, beaten; ///
Heat the oil in a large, deep frying pan over a medium heat and cook the potato for 5 mins. Add the curry powder and cook for 1 min until fragrant but the potato is just underdone.
Transfer to a bowl with the chicken, spring onions, korma sauce and mango chutney. Gently mix to combine.
Unroll both packs of pastry and cut out 4 x 17cm rounds. Dust the worktop with flour, reroll the trimmings and cut out 4 more rounds.
Divide the chicken mixture evenly between the pastry rounds, spooning it onto one-half of the circle, being careful not to overfill. Brush the edges with some of the egg, then fold the pastry over the filling and crimp the edges with your fingers. Arrange on 2 lined baking trays, then transfer to the fridge for 30 mins.
Preheat the oven to gas 4, 180°C, fan 160°C. Brush the pasties with the remaining egg, then bake for 50 mins-1 hr until golden. Serve with extra mango chutney for dipping, if you like. Will keep in an airtight container in the fridge for 1-2 days.
